## 1. Project Overview

The goal is to create a fullstack responsive web application that allows users to browse NBA players, search for specific players, add them to a favorites list, and view player statistics. The application consists of a frontend and backend that work together to provide a performant, user-friendly experience by leveraging the [balldontlie API](https://docs.balldontlie.io/#introduction).

## 2. Key Objectives

1. Display a paginated list of NBA players with search and filtering functionality.
2. Allow users to manage a favorites list (add/remove players).
3. Show player statistics for favorite players (latest + previous season data).
4. Implement a caching mechanism to ensure fast data retrieval and optimized API usage.
5. Ensure the application is responsive and follows SOLID principles for maintainable code.

## 3. Technical Design

### 3.1. Tech Stack

- **Frontend (FE)**: React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Backend (BE)**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Styling**: CSS Modules or CSS-in-JS for styling isolation
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit or React Query (as needed)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Sequelize ORM
- **API**: [balldontlie API](https://docs.balldontlie.io/#introduction)

> Note: The database is actually a cache, not a Database. We're optimizing for handling third-party APIs.

### 3.2. Component Breakdown

#### 3.2.1. Frontend Components

- **PlayerList**
  - Display a paginated list of players, implement search and filtering.
  - Allow users to add/remove players from their favorites.
- **FavoritesList**
  - Display users' favorite players and their stats.
  - Allow removing players from the favorites list.
- **PlayerCard** (Reusable Component)
  - Shared UI component to show player information.
- **LoadingIndicator** & **ErrorComponent**
  - Provide user feedback during data fetching and error handling.

#### 3.2.2. Backend Services

- **API Proxy Service**
  - Manage API requests to [balldontlie API], handle caching, rate limiting, and error responses.
  - Provide endpoints for fetching player data and managing favorites.
- **Cache and Database Management**
  - **PlayerCacheService**: A caching layer for efficient retrieval of player data.
  - **Database Models**: Use Sequelize to define models for players and their stats.

### 3.3. State Management Architecture

- **Redux Toolkit** for global state (e.g., favorites, UI states).
- **React Query** for managing server state (e.g., fetching player data, caching, revalidation).

### 3.4. API Interaction & Backend Flow

- **Backend to balldontlie API**

  - **API Proxy Service** acts as a middleman, allowing rate limiting and transforming data to match the database schema.
  - **Endpoints**:
    - `GET /players` for paginated player data.
    - `GET /players/search` for search functionality.
    - `GET /players/{id}/stats` for current season stats.

- **Backend Flow**
  - **Incoming Request** (e.g., `GET /player/:id`): The backend checks the database for a cached player record. If the record is stale or missing, the backend will fetch data from the [balldontlie API], normalize it, and store it in the database.

### 3.5. Error Handling & Loading States

- **Loading State**: Display loading indicators on player list, favorites list, and search.
- **Error Handling**: Provide user-friendly error messages for API issues, database errors, and network issues.

## 4. Composition - Ticket Breakdown

### 4.1. Frontend Tickets

1. **Ticket #FE1**: Create `PlayerList` Component

   - **Objective**: Implement the UI for the paginated list of NBA players.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Display 20 players per page, with pagination controls. Integrate search feature.
   - **Dependencies**: Requires API endpoint (`/players`) integration.

2. **Ticket #FE2**: Create `FavoritesList` Component

   - **Objective**: Display a list of players that users have added to their favorites.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Render player data along with basic statistics, remove players functionality.
   - **Dependencies**: Redux state for managing favorites.

3. **Ticket #FE3**: Create Reusable `PlayerCard` Component

   - **Objective**: Develop a reusable card UI component for player data.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Display player name, image, and basic details.

4. **Ticket #FE4**: Implement Search Feature for Players
   - **Objective**: Allow users to search players by name.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Search results update without page reload, search functionality integrated with API.

### 4.2. Backend Tickets

1. **Ticket #BE1**: Implement `PlayerCacheService`

   - **Objective**: Develop caching logic to retrieve player data from the DB or fetch from API.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Cache data and refresh if missing or stale. Integrate `getPlayerByIdAndUpdate()` method.

2. **Ticket #BE2**: Set Up API Proxy for `balldontlie`

   - **Objective**: Implement API proxy to manage requests to [balldontlie API] with rate limiting.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Proxy requests with appropriate rate limiting, transform responses for frontend use.

3. **Ticket #BE3**: Define `Player` and `PlayerStats` Models

   - **Objective**: Set up Sequelize models for players and their stats.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Models should align with API response data structure.

4. **Ticket #BE4**: Implement Endpoints for Player and Stats Retrieval
   - **Objective**: Develop Express routes for player listing, searching, and stats.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: `/players`, `/players/search`, and `/players/{id}/stats` should return correct data.

### 4.3. Technical Setup Tickets

1. **Ticket #TS1**: Set Up Project Boilerplate

   - **Objective**: Initialize frontend and backend projects with necessary dependencies and configuration.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: React app setup with Vite, Express backend setup, ESLint and Prettier configuration.
   - **Steps**:
     1. **Initialize Frontend**: Set up a new React project using Vite, integrate TypeScript, and add initial dependencies (React Router, Redux Toolkit, etc.).
     2. **Initialize Backend**: Set up Express project with TypeScript, add dependencies (express, nodemon, dotenv, etc.), and configure TypeScript.
     3. **Code Linting and Formatting**: Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality checks, ensuring consistent coding style across the project.
     4. **Project Structure**: Establish a directory structure for frontend and backend to maintain modularity (e.g., `src/components`, `src/pages`, `server/routes`, etc.).

2. **Ticket #TS2**: Configure Database and ORM

   - **Objective**: Set up PostgreSQL with Sequelize, create initial migrations.
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Database connection established, Sequelize configured, basic models defined.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

### High Priority User Stories

1. **List NBA Players**
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: When users access the app, they should see a paginated list of NBA players (20 per page).
2. **Add/Remove from Favorites**
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Users should be able to add/remove players to/from the favorites list, and changes should persist.
3. **Search Players**
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Users should be able to search by player name, with results updated immediately.
4. **View Player Stats**
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Display current season's statistics for players in the favorites list.
5. **Responsive Design**
   - **Acceptance Criteria**: Application UI should adjust seamlessly for mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Optimize caching and minimize API calls using `PlayerCacheService`.
- **Scalability**: Ensure modular codebase to allow new features to be added easily.
- **Security**: Secure API endpoints, implement rate limiting, and validate incoming requests.
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit, integration, and end-to-end tests using Jest and React Testing Library.

## 7. Next Steps

1. **Backend Implementation**: Complete database models and caching service.
2. **Frontend Feature Development**: Build core UI components based on the tickets.
3. **Testing**: Integrate testing into each user story development to validate features.
